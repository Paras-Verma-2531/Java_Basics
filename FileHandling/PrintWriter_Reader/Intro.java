    The problem faced by FileWriter and BufferedWriter are:
    it was difficult to insert new line(every time use \n")
    .solved by BufferedWriter by newLine() method
    but still it is a major problem.
    Also, we cannot write double/int/boolean data to the file.therefore, PrintWriter  class was introduced.
    -------------------------
    -------------------------
    The major advantage of printWriter over other Writers are:
    ::)we can write any primitive data to the file.

    -------------------
    -------------------
    constructors of PrintWriter
    --------------
    --------------
    PrintWriter pw= new PrintWriter("file name");
    PrintWriter pw= new PrintWriter("file reference");
    PrintWriter pw= new PrintWriter("Writer object");--- > as like BufferedWriter
    [NOTE]:: PrintWriter can communicate directly with the file or with the help of some other Writer Object.
=================================
=================================
-------METHODS---------
1.print()-----> to write sny data to file (primitive/ non-primitive)
2.println()---> to write data with new Line.
---------------
The most enhanced writer  to write data to the file is PrintWriter.
The most enhanced Reader to read data from the file is BufferedReader.
