        MultiThreading can be implemented in two ways:
        1. extending thread class
        2. runnable interface
        ::Multitasking: performing several task simultaneously
              ----process based multitasking----
              each process/task is independent of other task(this is not a programmatic based multitasking)
              ----Thread based multitasking----
              executing several threads/process simultaneously where each part is independent of other but is a part of same program.
                eg: A program contains 10k lines of code 5k-5k (we can compile both at same time rather than waiting for 1st to compile)
