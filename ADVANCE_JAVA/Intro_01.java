    Core Java concepts can be used to design stand-alone applications(SA).
    Stand-alone applications include:
    [Applications that require single computer for its execution]
    =======================
    1.GUI  applications[ desktop applications]
    2.CUI applications[ character user interface, console based applications ]
    ======================================
    Sometimes, we may require building web applications.
    for which knowledge of core java is not sufficient. Therefore, advanced java concepts
    are mandatory for Web based applications.
    like :: websites, servers etc
==============================================
==============================================
Advanced Java majorly include three technologies:
        1. JDBC
        2.SERVLETS
