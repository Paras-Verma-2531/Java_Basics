    ROLE OF JSPs ,SERVLETS,JDBC:::
    =======================================
    1.whenever we are required to display something to the end user::
     go for JSPs [ JAVA SERVER PAGES]// presentation logic
     JSPs are meant for view components.
     eg: waiter showing menu to the customer in restaurant.
     -----------------------------
     2. the internal processing is done by Servlets.
     eg: cookServlets  [someone who will prepare order and do the processing but won't be seen by the customer.i,e he will be doing the
     work internally]
     Hence, Servlets are used for Internal Processing:
     -----------------------------
     3.     If the servlets require some data/ items from the database, it will contact through JDBC.
     thus, A technology require making connection between servlets and database is JDBC.
     EG: if a cook require some item from the store, he will contact someone  who will thus, fulfill his request.
     ------------------------------
