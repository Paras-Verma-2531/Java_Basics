    Classes inside the classes are known as InnerClasses.
    The main purpose of innerclass were to fix the bug  of GUI in event handling.
    however, it became so popular that programmers started using it in regular coding.
    -----when to use innerclass concept-------
    without existing one type of object, if there is no chance for other object:: then we can use innerclass
    eg::
    class university
    {
       class department
       {
       }

     }
     here department depends on uni:: hence it is inner class
     */
}
