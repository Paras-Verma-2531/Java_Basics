       An array is an indexed of fixed no of homo data elements.
       the main advantage of arrays is we can represent values with same variable:[code readability]
       Disadvantages::
        : fixed size
        : homogeneous
        : no inbuilt method
        =======================
        these problems can be solved using collections::
          collections are growable
          collections are Hetrogeneous
          collections have inbuilt method.
          ==================
          =================
          collection::==> whenever we are required to represent group of objects as single entity:
          Collections framework:: it contains group of classes and interface.
